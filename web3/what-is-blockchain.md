# What Is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a **decentralized, distributed, and shared digital ledger** composed of blocks of transactions linked chronologically to form a tamper-proof chain secured with cryptography.

## The Problem: Centralized Trust

Our world relies on intermediaries (banks, tech companies, election committees) creating vulnerabilities:

### Flaws of Centralized Money

- **Absolute Control**: Central institutions can freeze assets, block transactions, or deny service
- **Exclusion**: People without access to banking infrastructure are locked out of the global economy
- **Lack of Privacy & Censorship**: Transactions can be monitored, blocked, or censored

### Flaws of Centralized Agreements

- Central authorities act as the "source of truth" for collective agreements
- When trust erodes, there's no mathematical way to verify or settle disputes
- Citizens cannot independently audit processes like elections

## The Solution: A Trust-Minimized System

Blockchain creates a system where participants rely on **transparent, verifiable mathematics and code** instead of trusting institutions.

### Core Components

#### 1. Shared, Decentralized Ledger

- A single, shared digital record book copied across thousands of computers worldwide
- Each computer holding a copy is called a **node**
- Nodes form a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network** with no central server or single point of failure
- Transactions propagate from node to node until everyone has an identical copy

#### 2. Blocks

- Transactions are bundled together into groups called **blocks**
- Think of a block as a single page in the global record book

#### 3. The Chain (Cryptographic Linking)

- **Hash**: Each block's data produces a unique cryptographic fingerprint
- **Linking**: Each new block contains its own hash AND the previous block's hash
- This creates an unbroken mathematical chain back to the first block

#### 4. Immutability

- Altering any old transaction changes that block's hash
- This breaks the link to subsequent blocks, cascading down the chain
- The network automatically rejects fraudulent versions, preserving the true record

#### 5. Digital Currency (Cryptocurrency)

- Native currencies that exist purely on the ledger
- Enables direct, secure value transfer without central authority permission

## Key Benefits

- **Transparent**: Open and verifiable by all participants
- **Secure**: Cryptographically protected and tamper-proof
- **Decentralized**: No single point of control or failure
- **Permissionless**: No gatekeepers required to participate
