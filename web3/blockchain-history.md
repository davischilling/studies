# The Genesis of Blockchain: From Digital Cash to Bitcoin

## Bitcoin: The First Decentralized Digital Currency

- **Created in 2008** by anonymous person/group **Satoshi Nakamoto**
- Bitcoin is both a digital currency AND the decentralized network (blockchain) it operates on
- Called "digital gold" due to its **provably finite supply** (max 21 million Bitcoin)
- **First system** allowing two people to send/store value digitally without a trusted intermediary

## The Double-Spend Problem

The inherent risk that digital currency can be spent more than once.

- **Physical cash**: Once you hand over a $20 bill, you no longer possess it
- **Digital information**: Like emailing a photo—you send a copy but keep the original
- Without solving this, digital money would be worthless

### Early Attempts

- **DigiCash (1980s)**: Used a central authority to validate transactions
- **Fatal flaw**: Central entity had absolute control (freeze funds, reject transactions, censor users)
- Defeated the purpose of a system free from centralized control

## The Byzantine Generals Problem

A classic computer science dilemma about achieving consensus without a central leader.

**The Analogy:**

- Byzantine generals surround an enemy city
- Must agree on a coordinated attack time
- Can only communicate via messengers (some may be traitors)
- How can loyal generals reach consensus despite false information?

**Applied to Blockchain:**

- Network of nodes must agree on valid transactions and their order
- Must work even if some nodes are malicious (attempting double-spends)

## Satoshi Nakamoto's Solution (2008 Whitepaper)

Solved both the double-spend and Byzantine Generals problems with Bitcoin:

- **Distributed ledger**: Every participant holds a copy of the entire transaction history
- **Peer-to-peer verification**: Network collectively verifies transactions
- **Block creation**: Transactions bundled into "blocks" added to the "chain"
- **Permanent record**: Creates an unchangeable history

### Credibly Neutral System

- **Neutrality**: Network is impartial—doesn't know/care about user identity, location, or purpose
- **Credibility**: Rules are in open-source code, enforced by the entire decentralized network
- **Result**: Global, permissionless, censorship-resistant monetary system

## Ethereum: Evolution to a World Computer

Launched in **2015** by **Vitalik Buterin** and co-founders.

- Native currency: **Ether (ETH)**
- Expands blockchain beyond money to **agreements**
- Superpower: Ability to run **smart contracts** (code on the blockchain)

## Smart Contracts

First described by cryptographer **Nick Szabo in 1994**, made practical by blockchain.

**Definition**: Digital agreements where terms are written in code, living on the blockchain, with the network automatically enforcing rules and executing outcomes.

### Traditional vs. Smart Contract

| Traditional (Buying a House) | Smart Contract (Flight Insurance) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Multiple intermediaries (banks, lawyers, title agents) | Code executes automatically |
| Slow and expensive | Instant execution |
| Requires trust in each party | No claims to file, no arguments |
| Terms can be disputed | Immutable logic enforces agreement |

## Bitcoin vs. Ethereum

| Bitcoin | Ethereum |
|---------|----------|
| Like a **calculator** | Like a **world computer** |
| Intentionally simple | Flexible platform |
| Secure store of value & medium of exchange | Runs unstoppable applications |
| Turing incomplete (limited functionality) | Turing complete (complex smart contracts) |
| Maximizes security and reliability | Enables vast range of decentralized apps |
